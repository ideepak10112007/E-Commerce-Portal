This project is a single-page E-Commerce demo named LuciDeep, built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (all in one file). 
It showcases a modern storefront with category-based product browsing (tech, groceries, appliances, fashion), real-time product images from the web, and fully client-side functionality using `localStorage`—so it runs without any backend.
